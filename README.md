# Gamified-Project-Management-Database-Design
Project management system database with gamifications developed using Microsoft SQL server
The main goal of this project was to develop an efficient database schema capable of managing core project data such as users, teams, projects, and tasks, along with gamification elements. The key deliverables include entity-relationship ER diagrams and the SQL queries used for the actual database creation. The database was implemented using SQL Server, and sample data was included to illustrate the initial structure and data entry process. To sum up, this database is intended to serve as a solid foundation for the future development of a fully functional gamified project management application.
